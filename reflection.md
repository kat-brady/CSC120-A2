What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was very frustrating for me, since I did not understand the instructions for 90% of my time spent working on it and I have no experience with object oriented programming. Working while I was stressed definitely did not work, as I found that giving myself a little grace and coming back to the assignment was really all I needed to fix my bugs. I also discovered that I probably should start earlier than I think I need to in order to complete my assignments. I had a lot of confusion about the class thing and where things were assigned, but I think I understand better now. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to start early, take it slow, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification if it would benefit them.
